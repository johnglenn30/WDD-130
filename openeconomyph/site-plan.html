    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>One of the many driving factors of a progressive nation is its economy, this website advocates that the Philippines should open up its economy and remove unnecessary restrictions. This site will provide knowledge and understanding on explaining how opening the economy will better the lives of Filipinos.

    <h3>Home page</h3>
    <p>
        OPENECONOMYPH.COM is created with the desire to improve the economic situation of the Philippines, to help improve the lives of many Filipinos, from private businesses by opening the economy to foreign investors and espousing competition to both local and foreign which is the drive of making better products and services as well as better salaries, and more work opportunities to Filipinos they will employ. 
        The current situation of the Philippine economy needs more improvement and needs more competition. How the economy is run, affects our lives greatly and that through this website and the information provided may help educate many Filipinos and call for reforms in the economy. 
        The site will tackle the “Why’s” of the needed economic reforms, as well as the disadvantages of it. A good economy affects the very personal lives of the people and should be taken seriously, that is why the site will also tackle the hard criticisms of letting foreigners into the Philippines Small, Medium or Large Enterprises. Concerns of foreign players taking over the economy should also be tackled and how the government create rules that will not make local or foreign investors at a disadvantage in using open market principles.

    <h3>[Page 2]<br>INFORMATION</h3>
    <p>
    In visiting the website people will have access to all the data that are required to have a basic understanding of the economy, as well as other related information that can help deepen their understanding of economic principles. Related articles and other information about how our protectionist constitutional law may or may not be helping our economic progress as a country as well as what other laws and policies the government has created towards a more open market economy.
The site will also have a survey page that can also help gather data from its visitors regarding their economic understanding and their economic beliefs. The site might need a translated version to Tagalog , Cebuano, and other local languages to reach more Filipinos. A page will also be dedicated so that even grade schoolers will have also have a simple understanding of the economy and hopefully this will become one of the sites that will come up when searching about the Philippine economy.
The Philippines although is not a closed economy but how the economy works seems more protectionist than capitalist.

One of the co-founders of this movement is Mr. Orion Dumdum who himself is an OFW working in Singapore and have researched and studied all the needed facts that are needed to a better Philippines who is also a creator of the website correctphilippines.org that has the complete of the 3 point agenda that the movement is advocating.
