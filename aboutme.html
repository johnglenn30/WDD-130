    <h3>Hey guys! I saw your about me html page and you are all awesome!</h3>
    <p>The pandemic has been a real eye-opener for me, this also gave me the opportunity to learn more about technology, programming and web development. Thanks to BYU Pathway Connect I am able to learn and further my education and hopefully to a fulfilling career. </p>
    <p>BYU Pathway is truly a revelation from God. A blessing for all of us who strive to improve ourselves, to be more capable to serve others and bless our families. </p>
    <p> I am from the Philippines and am looking forward to learning together with you!</p>
